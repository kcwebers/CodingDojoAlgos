// Word/Logic Problems!

// Vampires and the sleeping man

// Consider a village with vampires and a sleeping man (who never wakes up, no matter what).
// A vampire can eat the sleeping man, but after eating him, the vampire falls asleep.
// Similarly, any vampire can eat any other sleeping vampire, and this process repeats.
// Assume that the vampires are very smart and would ALWAYS choose to stay alive than to eat the man and risk their lives.
// Initially, there are 65 vampires and 1 sleeping man. What would happen in the village?

// ===========================
// Ideas
// ===========================

// the vampires would divvy up the man to eat him? Nope! Only one vampire can eat at once (assume they don't get along per se... there was great turmoil in the vampire community after the fall of Dracula)
// the vampires are vegetarians... nope they are not
// they kill the sleeping man then eat him, nope
