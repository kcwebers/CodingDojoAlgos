// Bonus riddle:

// John gave his brother James a box:
// About it there were many locks.
// James woke and said it gave him pain;
// So gave it back to John again.
// The box was not with lid supplied
// Yet caused two lids to open wide:
// And all these locks had never a key
// What kind of box, then, could it be?
