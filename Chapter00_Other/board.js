# Card Flip Shuffle #

You are in a dark room with a deck of cards. A certain number of the cards are face up and the rest are face down. You can't see the cards. How do you divide the deck in to two piles with equal numbers of face up cards in each? So, it doesn't matter how many cars each deck HashChangeEvent, just that the number of face up cards match ##

* You know how many cards are flipped, but you cannot see the deck of cards no matter what and the deck is shuffled, so the flipped cards could be anywhere in the deck.
