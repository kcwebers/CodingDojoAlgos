# Finding An Average on the Down Low

### Three Employees want to know the average of their salaries. They are not allowed to share their individual salaries.
* They cannot directly share their own salaries in anyway, which includes writing things down. 

# Ideas

* bag of skittles, each skittle has a monetary value. Put all skittles together and divide by 3 = average.
* - this still wouldnt work because the separate employees would still be directly communicating their dsalaries, hust through a different medium

* add a 'salt' onto each salary. As the average is being calculated, remove salts of each individual salary.

* basically,idea #2 was closest. You add a kind of 'salt' to each person's salary and pass along the sum. At the end you then syphon out the salts and ultimately divide for the average.
