// Taco Truck
//joe drives a taco truck in the booming town of squaresburo
//he uses an array of [x,y] coordinates corresponding to customer locations.
// they walk to his truck, but he wants to minimize the total distance from truck to customers.
//city blocks are perfect squares, and every street is a two way.
//he only parks by street corners.  customers only travel on streets.
//joe checks the array of customer coordinates before deciding where to parks
//given an array of coordinates, return an optinmal location where the total distance is the least.
// [[10,0],[-1,-10],[2,4]]  ==> [2,0] : total distance 25
